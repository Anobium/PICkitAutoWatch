== Interrupts Tab

*Introduction:*

This tab shows the Great Cow BASIC interrupts for the microcontroller.

The three colums shows the Great Cow BASIC interrupt name, the bit Great Cow BASIC will use to enable the interrupt and the bit Great Cow BASIC will use to clear the interrupt after the interrupt routine has completed..&#160;&#160;
All Great Cow BASIC interrupts are available within user programs when using `ON INTERRUPT`.

For specific details of a interrupt, please refer to the microcontroller datasheet, the errata for the microcontroller or ask a question on the Great Cow BASIC forum, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/gcbasic/forums
