== Introducing PICInfo


Welcome to the PICInfo software.  A support application for Great Cow BASIC.

This application supports Microchip PIC microcontrollers only, for AVR see AVRInfo.

This is a free application that generates configuration code to be inserted into your project.&#160;&#160;
Using an intuitive interface, it enables and configures the coniguration functions specific to your application.

The application also provides details of the microcontroller in terms of parameters like registers, register bits, interrupts.&#160;&#160;
PICInfo supports 8-bit PIC microcontrollers.
